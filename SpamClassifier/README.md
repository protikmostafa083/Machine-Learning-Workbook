## Brief

I have used the dataset from UCI machine learning Repository. Here I have tried to classify spam messages. The Dataset has more than 5.5K records.
I have tried different techniques here, I have used:
* Stemming
* Lemmatization
* Bag of Words
* TF-IDF
* Removing Class Imbalance Factor.

I have tried all the combination from this aforementioned list and noted the accuracy. Maximum Accuracy 98.81% was obtained by using Stemming and Bag of Words. For all the operations here, I have used Naive Bayes Classifier. I have used MultinomialNB. It works better with NLP problems as it works comletely based on probabilistic operations. 

So, In a nutshell, Maximum accuracy is obtained with the combination of Naive Bayes Classifier(MultinomialNB), Stemming and Bag of Word Model.
